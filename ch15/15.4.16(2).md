| Cut                | A          | B          | Difference    | Rank        | Sign        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Shoulder           | 5          | 7          | -2            | 7.5         | -           |
| Chuck roast        | 6          | 5          |  1            | 3.5         | +           |
| Rib steak          | 8          | 9          | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| Brisket            | 4          | 5          | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| Club steak         | 9          | 9          |  0            | -           | 0           |
| Round steak        | 3          | 5          | -2            | 7.5         | -           |
| Rump roast         | 7          | 6          |  1            | 3.5         | +           |
| Sirloin steak      | 8          | 8          |  0            | -           | 0           |
| Sirloin tip steak  | 8          | 9          | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| T-bone steak       | 9          | 10         | -1            | 3.5         | -           |

1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (A = B)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (A $\neq$ B)   with n = 10-2=8 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . Test statistic = T = number of plus signs (+)

4 . Realized statistic: T<sup>*</sup> = 2

5 . Use Table 1 with n = 8 and p = 0.5

Because this is a two-tailed test, we look for the critical values where the cumulative probability is $\alpha$/2 = 0.025

By the table, we can get the critical values are 4 (lower)

RR: {T &le; 4 }

6 . Because 2 &in; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> does be rejected. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the two tenderizers tends to receive higher ratings than the other.
