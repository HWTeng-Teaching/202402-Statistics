### Solution
-  the properties of the normal distribution
   - Symmetry: The normal distribution is a symmetric distribution, with its probability density function forming a symmetric bell-shaped curve.
   - Unimodality: The normal distribution is unimodal, meaning it has only one peak on its distribution curve.
   - Defined by Two Parameters: The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread.
   - 68-95-99.7 Rule: In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% within three standard deviations.

- Conclusion
  - the size between 0% to 25% versus the size between 75% to 100%  is not equal
  - the size between 25% to 50% versus the size between 50% to 75%  is not equal
  - Therefore, the data is not normally distributed.

* Comment:
   * The conclusion is wrong.  
   * Recall from Section 7.4 that samples from normal distributions should results in histograms and stem and leaf plots exhibiting a relatively mound shape. Boxplots should be relatively symmetric with no outliers       and normal probability plots should have points reasonably close to a straight-line pattern with no systematic pattern that is not a straight line.  
   * Since the boxplot is symmetric with no outliers, hence we should conclude "Approximately normal."
